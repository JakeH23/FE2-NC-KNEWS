About
NC News is a social news website and forum where content is socially curated and promoted by site members through voting. 

NC News requires the user to login in order to view the content. Once logged in, the user remains logged in for the duration of your browser session thus allowing them to naviagate through all pages and intereact with the content. NC Knews provides the user with a plethora of articles which can be viewed on a broader spectrum through topics. Each article allows the user to intereact with it and can vote the articles up or down using the API. The user has the ability to add comments of their own and also, like the articles, vote on other users comments. The user can add and delete articles of their own and in addtion to adding comments, they can alos delete their own.

Northcoders News was built in React, using Reach Router. This Front End uses Axios to make requests and relies on a Back-End API, which has been deployed here: https://jhnc-news.herokuapp.com/api/

## Requirements
    Node.js
    React.js
    @reach/router: ^1.2.1
    axios: ^0.18.0
    react: ^16.6.3


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
