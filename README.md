## NC Knews
A deployed version of this project can be found here: https://jh-nc-knews.netlify.com

NC Knews is a social news website and forum where content is socially curated and promoted by site members through voting. 

NC Knews requires the user to login in order to view the content. Once logged in, the user remains logged in for the duration of your browser session thus allowing them to navigate through all pages and interact with the content. NC Knews provides the user with a plethora of articles which can be viewed on a broader spectrum through topics. Each article allows the user to interact with it and can vote the articles up or down using the API. The user has the ability to add comments of their own and also, like the articles, vote on other users comments. The user can add and delete articles of their own and in addition to adding comments, they can also delete their own.

NC Knews was built in ReactJS, using Reach Router. This Front End uses Axios to make requests and relies on a Back-End API, which has been deployed here: https://jhnc-news.herokuapp.com/api/
